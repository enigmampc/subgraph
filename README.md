# Enigma Subgraph

## Running Graph Node

The Docker Compose setup requires an Ethereum network name and node
to connect to. By default, it will use `mainnet:http://host.docker.internal:9545`
in order to connect to an Ethereum node running on your host machine.
You can replace this with anything else in `docker-compose.yaml`.

> **Note for Linux users:** On Linux, `host.docker.internal` is not
> currently supported. Instead, you will have to replace it with the
> IP address of your Docker host (from the perspective of the Graph
> Node container).
> To do this, run:
>
> ```
> CONTAINER_ID=$(docker container ls | grep graph-node | cut -d' ' -f1)
> docker exec $CONTAINER_ID /bin/bash -c 'ip route | awk "/^default via /{print $3}"'
ï¿¼
> ```
>
> This will print the host's IP address. Then, put it into `docker-compose.yml`:
>
> ```
> sed -i -e 's/host.docker.internal/<IP ADDRESS>/g' docker-compose.yml
> ```

### Steps to start the subgraph locally
#### Install the dependencies
```
yarn install
```

#### Generate the code from the subgraph schema
```
yarn codegen
```

#### Start the subgraph locally
```
yarn start-local
```

This will start IPFS, Postgres and Graph Node in Docker and create persistent
data directories for IPFS and Postgres in `./data/ipfs` and `./data/postgres`. You
can access these via:

- Graph Node:
  - GraphiQL: `http://localhost:8000/`
  - HTTP: `http://localhost:8000/subgraphs/name/<subgraph-name>`
  - WebSockets: `ws://localhost:8001/subgraphs/name/<subgraph-name>`
  - Admin: `http://localhost:8020/`
- IPFS:
  - `127.0.0.1:5001` or `/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/5001`
- Postgres:
  - `postgresql://graph-node:let-me-in@localhost:5432/graph-node`


#### Create the subgraph `enigmampc/enigma`
Run this in a different terminal
```
yarn create-local
```

#### Deploy the subgraph
```
yarn deploy-local
```

This is the last step, from now on you should see all the data being created.

## To run a clean subgraphs session
  - Remove the `data/`, `build/` and `generated/` folders:
    ```
    sudo rm -rf data build generated
    ````
  - Re-generate the code, and restart:
    ```
    yarn codegen && yarn start-local
    ```
  - Wait for the previous command to finish starting up and re-deploy: 
    ```
    yarn create-local && yarn deploy-local
    ```

## To update current subgraphs
  - Do the proper changes to the code
  - Re-generate the code, and restart:
    ```
    yarn codegen && yarn start-local
    ```
  - Wait for the previous command to finish starting up and re-deploy:
    ```
    yarn deploy-local
    ```
